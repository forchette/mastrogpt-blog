"But I can't understand, isn't Kubernetes a platform for microservices?"

"No, Kubernetes at best is a container orchestrator. There is a huge difference."

"What is the difference, sorry?"

"Think about the difference between going to a shop and buying a working radio, or ordering an electronic kit to do build the radio by yourself ."

"But Kubernetes also have Knative ...."

"Which is not a F.A.A.S.  but a serverless workload manager."

"And what it means?"

"It is as if they bundle the do-it-yourself kit with the soldering iron."

"What about OpenFaas then? They say it's simple"

"Exactly. Simple. Very simple."

"So what is the problem then?"

"Well, if OpenWhisk is a radio, then OpenFaas is just an antenna."

"But can't I use Lambda instead?"

"It's like buying a subscription to a concert season, instead of buying a radio."
