I remember that in 2001 I started working as a support for a product called FutureTense, which already had all the features of an advanced CMS back then.

It was the period when websites were made "by hand". The HTML pages were composed by hand and the files were uploaded via FTP where "web space" was provided. And the bookstores were full of books on HTML.

And I had in front of my nose a contraption that defined a content model, applied rendering logic, with incremental publishing tools. But there was no way to explain: learn THIS stuff, which is the future, not HTML ...

The problem is always repeated the same: in the beginning, enthusiasts want to learn everything. It was once HTML, today it is Docker. Back then the pages were uploaded via FTP, today they are put on Kubernetes. It seems that it is "the right way" and that the only way is "do-it-yourself".

The lucky ones are those who instead avoid incomplete technology and go to the final solution. I say it again: the containers and Kubernetes are only a part of the cloud-native, they are NOT the solution.

There are complete solutions, such as nimbella, and in a few years nobody will use Kubernetes alone but only as part of complete products that solve the whole problem and not just a piece.
