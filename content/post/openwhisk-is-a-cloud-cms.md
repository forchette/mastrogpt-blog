In 2001 I started supporting a product that already had all the features of an advanced CMS back then.

It was the period when websites were "hand-written". You created web pages  with an editor, frequently just a text editor, and uploaded via FTP in a "web space" offered by ISP.  Bookstores had books on HTML everywhere.

At that time I was already working with a tool that worked like a modern CMS: it defined a content model, applied rendering logic, offered a tool to incrementally publishing. 

But there was no way to explain to people: forget HTML and use a tool like this, instead.

The problem repeat itself all the time. In the beginning, enthusiasts want to learn the foundations. It was once HTML, today it is Docker. 

Back then, pages were uploaded via FTP, today they put code on Kubernetes. It seems that it is "the right way" and that the only way is "do-it-yourself".

The lucky ones are those who instead avoid incomplete technology and wait for the complete  solution. I want to say it again:  containers and Kubernetes are only a (small) part of the cloud-native approach; they are NOT the solution.

There are complete solutions. OpenWhisk is one  such as nimbella, and in a few years nobody will use Kubernetes alone but only as part of complete products that solve the whole problem and not just a piece.
